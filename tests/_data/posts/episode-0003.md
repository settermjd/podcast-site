### Synopsis

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with voice of the PHP community, the one and only, [Cal Evans](http://blog.calevans.com/), about one of his books - [Going Pro](https://leanpub.com/goingpro).

We talk about a range of things, including what motivated him to write the book, how the book's been received, people Cal believes are excellent examples of professional programmers, **and much, much more**. Join me for what is a truly excellent fireside chat about some of the key aspects of being a professional.
