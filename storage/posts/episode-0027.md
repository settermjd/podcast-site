### Synopsis

In this episode, I'm very excited to be back after so long away from the mic! I'm so excited that I'm overflowing, effervescing even with ideas, enthusiasm, and passion to be back behind the mic with you.

But seriously, in this episode, I'm sharing with you my experiences from two excellent conferences: Write the Docs (Prague) and PHP Developer Day 2017 (Dresden).

After that, I going to share what I learned about meeting people at both events, getting over nervousness and caution, and making the most of the opportunity that communities are. And right at the end, there's a cheeky book promotion.

Grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and let's ponder on these questions, and so many others that go along with them.
