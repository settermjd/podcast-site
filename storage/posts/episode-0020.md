### Synopsis

In this episode we pick up where we left off in [episode 19](/episode/episode-0019), with a slight segway. But, instead of starting to look at how to use Twitter, and other social media tools, let’s talk about something more important.

In this episode let’s talk about finding perspective and balance. There’s quite a bit to cover, but I tried to condense it to the essentials. Today, let’s talk about finding a balance between the amount of work you have, the quality of said work, and the amount you get paid for it.

To help you do that, if you’re having trouble, I’ll ask you a series of questions:

- How much money do you need?
- How much do you need to work to earn that money?

Then to balance these questions, to keep them in perspective, I’ll ask a few more, including:

- How much is your health worth?
- How much is your family worth?

There’s a lot going on. So, grab your favourite beverage and your comfy chair, and get ready for a rousing fireside chat.
