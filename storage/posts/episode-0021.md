### Synopsis

In this episode I sit down with Asciidoc project Lead, and all round good fella - Dan Allen. If you love technical writing, technical documentation, and documenting your code, then this is an episode you're not going to want to miss.

Dan share's so much valuable insight into why Asciidoc is the premiere format for writing, regardless of the type of work you do, how the format came to life, some of the tooling available, plus so much more.

If youâ€™re just getting in to technical writing, love documenting your code, but want to spend less time doing it, or just want to find a tool chain that demands less of you, but gives you so much more, then grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and tune in!
