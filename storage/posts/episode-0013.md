### Synopsis

In this episode I have a fireside chat with the voice of Nomad PHP, Joe P. Ferguson. Joe shares how he got started as the voice of Nomad PHP. He gives a rousing tale of what it was like to effectively build the community from scratch, with nothing but the backing of Cal Evans to open doors for him. Ok, Cal's name is legendary in the PHP community.

He also shares what it's been like for him personally, growing over that time, and how he keeps sounding so passionate and enthusiastic on the show. You won't believe his secret. As well as this, we talk about being a conference speaker, whether that's starting out, or being a professional, along with some of the ups, downs, dos and don'ts.

And what would a chat with Joe be without a bit of Laravel. So grab your favourite beverage, your comfy chair, and get ready for a rousing fireside chat with Joe and I.
