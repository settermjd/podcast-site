### Synopsis

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with Troy Hunt. Troy's a Microsoft MVP for Security, PluralSight author, and public speaker.

We talk about what it takes to build a brand, and an online profile, over the long term, as well as what it takes to be a being a professional public speaker.

It's a very valuable chat, where Troy gives the benefit of what hears learned over the last 6+ years. So join us for this and, as always, **much, much more**.
