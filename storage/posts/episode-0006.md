### Synopsis

In this episode, I have, part two of, a fireside chat with, [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) aficionado and [Roave](http://roave.com) stalwart, [Gary Hockin](https://twitter.com/@geeh) about the ins and outs of building both a brand and a reputation as a freelancer.

We talk about a range of tools freelancers, *as well as full time employees*, can use, including social media, speaking at conferences, and getting on podcasts, to build a reputation and brand for themselves, even if they're just starting out.

So join us for this and, as always, **much, much more**.
