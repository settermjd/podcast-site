### Synopsis

In this episode, I have, part two of, a fireside chat with, Zend Framework aficionado and Roave stalwart, Gary Hockin about the ins and outs of building both a brand and a reputation as a freelancer. 

We talk about a range of tools freelancers, *as well as full time employees*, can use, including social media, speaking at conferences, and getting on podcasts, to build a reputation and brand for themselves, even if they're just starting out. So join us for this and, as always, **much, much more**.
