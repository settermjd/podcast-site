### Synopsis

Often we get lost up in doing the work, searching for new clients, networking with peers and the wider community, and overall being productive. But it can be easy to forget why we became a freelancer in the first place.

So, in this episode I’m going solo so that I can ask two key questions that are essential to be asked when you’re a freelance.

Grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and let’s ponder on these questions, and so many others that go along with them.
