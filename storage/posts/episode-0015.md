### Synopsis

In this episode I chat with Adam Culp, founder of the Sunshine PHP, in sunny south Florida, about starting and running conferences, project estimates, and being professional developers.

In our fireside chat we start off by having a lively discussion about how Sunshine PHP got started. Adam shares what inspired him to kick off a conference in sunny Florida, as well as how you can do it too. He provides a number of tips, suggestions, and insights as to what it takes.

We then chat, at length, about one of his personal bugbears, thumb-suck time estimates for software projects. This is some seriously quality advice for any developer, regardless of where you are in your career. If you're not good at estimates, or have been burned by working with people who aren't, you won't want to miss this.

Grab your favourite beverage and your comfy chair, and get ready for a rousing fireside chat with Adam and I.

#### Key Takeaways

- Most of the work involved in organising a conference is done in only 4 months
- Make lists, be organised, and be prepared - don't leave things till the last minute
- Use free tools, such as Google Calendar to keep you organised.
