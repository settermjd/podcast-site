### Synopsis

In this episode, I talk to Laravel creator, Taylor Otwell, a man who needs no introduction.
I met Taylor for the first time at PHP World in 2015, and caught up with him again at ZendCon in 2016.

He’s someone who I very quickly clicked with, both for his technical knowledge, and also for his reservedness. I felt that he had quite a story to tell, one that’s perhaps overlooked among all the buzz surrounding Laravel and its wider community.

So, grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and come learn more about Taylor, what it was like in the early days of Laravel before he was at it full-time, and what it’s like to build real products that make money and pay the bills.
