### Synopsis

In this episode, I have the absolute pleasure of speaking with one of my mentors, Zend Framework project lead, Matthew Weier O'Phinney. In addition to being a very experienced developer, Matthew's a very thoughtful and considerate person.

Here's some highlights from the chat:

- How Matthew came to work at Zend, on Zend Framework and Zend Expressive.
- His plans for the future of Zend Framework and Zend Expressive.
- Tips & advice for new developers and developers new to PHP, Zend Framework and Zend Expressive.
- How to grow from a junior to a senior developer/software craftsman/woman.
- How to handle conference speaking nerves.

Grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and come hear from one of the PHP community's true gentlemen.
