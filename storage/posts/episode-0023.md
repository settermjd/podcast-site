### Synopsis

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with Ophelie Lechat, SitePoint's manager of operations
We talk about a whole range of topics, but mostly about how to get developers to communicate.

I felt that Ophelie was in a unique position, given her wealth of experience across a variety of roles at SitePoint to be able to give the best insights.

She shared with me a number of ways that she, and the other staff are able to being, perhaps even the most introverted of developers, out of their shells.

So grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and come find out how Ophelie motivates developers to come out of their shell, and share what they know with the rest of us.
