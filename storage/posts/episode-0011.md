### Synopsis

In this episode I have a fireside chat about what it’s like to live the life of a developer evangelist with Jack Skinner, otherwise known as @developerjack, whilst he was at the first BuzzConf. He talked with me about the crazy hours, random locations, shared some stories from the road, such as having a conference call whilst walking down the boarding gate to catch a flight.

If you don’t, yet, know Jack, he’s a developer evangelist at MYOB, which is an Australian Software Accounting firm, the market leader I believe. He shared so much gold in this chat that I’m itching to share it with you. Here’s a summary of the key things he said.

- An evangelist works closely with the community
- He helps developers build awesome software, preferably with our (MYOB’s) platform
- You’re always still learning
- Be really passionate
- Be passionate about one particular thing and grow it from there
- Speak from the heart about what you love

He’s a very warm, genuine, and passionate person, so I know you’re going to love this episode.
