### Synopsis

In this episode I have a fireside chat with sagely Rob Allen, about being one of the leads on the Slim 3 project, and about the constraints and decisions developers need to make.

This was one of the best fireside chats I’ve had, because the advice resonated so deeply with me. Besides getting an inside glimpse into the Slim project, and what it’s like to be a maintainer on such a wildly popular and successful open source project; Rob shared with me the importance of other areas, besides the code, which we often are all so precious about.

So grab a coffee, or put the kettle on - this is a fireside chat I know you’ll love.
