### Synopsis

In this episode I chat with Chris Hartjes, the Grumpy Programmer himself, about the ins and outs of testing and what it’s like to spend part of your working week building your dreams, instead of someone else’s.

Amongst the talk on testing, we cover a range of interesting points, such as monkey patching, mutation testing, and how TDD is more a design process than anything else. When it comes to building your dream, Chris shares some personal insights in to what prompted him to build grumpy learning, and who some of his greatest mentors have been.

Grab your favourite beverage and your comfy chair, and get ready for a rousing fireside chat with Chris and I.
