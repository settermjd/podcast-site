### Synopsis

In this episode I chat with Chris Cornutt, founder of PHPDeveloper.org, websec.io, and Lone Star PHP about conferences and all things security.

It's a rousing chat about the state of security within the PHP and wider development community. He also gives me an inside look at what it's like to run the long-running Lone Star PHP conference in Texas.

Grab your favourite beverage and your comfy chair, and get ready for a rousing fireside chat with Chris and I.
