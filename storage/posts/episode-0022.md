### Synopsis

In this episode, I have the pleasure of speaking with Wes Bos.
If you’re not familiar with Wes, he’s a designer, developer, entrepreneur, speaker, and teacher.

He’s the author of such standout courses as _JavaScript30_, _ES6 for Everyone_, _React For Beginners_, and the author of _Sublime Text Power User_.
Hopefully, you’re familiar with at least one.

During the fireside chat, Wes shared so much gold with me, gold that, if you’re interested in creating online courses, or already are, I know you’re going to love.

Here are a few points to listen out for:

- Learn to cut the fat and don’t ramp up
- People like to relate to you and to get to know you.
- Know your audience well.

So grab your favorite beverage, put your feet up, and let’s ponder on these questions and so many others that go along with them.
